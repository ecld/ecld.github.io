            <p class="speaker-name">Dr. Iris Nomikou</p>
            <p class="speaker-bio">Iris Nomikou is co-Director of the Research Centre for Interaction, Development and Diversity and Senior Lecturer in Psychology at the University of Portsmouth, UK. Her work crosses disciplinary boundaries and draws from interactional linguistics, cognitive science, and developmental psychology. She studies everyday interactions using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to holistically capture the ways in which early interactional experiences provide the ecology within which children participate in meaning making and discover and learn language, She has worked extensively on the interplay between talk and bodily experience for the development of meaning. Taking a continuity approach to the development of language she is interested in the creative solutions and different developmental paths that children use in learning to get things done with language, and has therefore also worked with recordings of children from different cultural communities as well as atypically developing children.</p>

            <p class="speaker-name">Dr. Nicolás Alessandroni</p>
            <p class="speaker-bio">Nicolás Alessandroni is a postdoctoral fellow at the Concordia Infant Research Laboratory (Concordia University, Canada), currently supported by the Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Société et Culture. Grounded in ecological psychology, his research interests encompass three core topics: how children discover and engage with increasingly complex possibilities for action, how interactions with caregivers shape and accelerate this process, and how developmental science can refine theories and methods to better capture these dynamics. Alongside this, Nicolás leads and participates in projects within large-scale collaborative networks such as ManyBabies and ManyManys, investigating how Open Science and Big Team Science approaches can work together to advance our understanding of human development. Nicolás received his PhD in Psychology from the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (Spain) in 2021, where his research centered on the relationship between object use and early conceptual development. In recognition of this work, he was awarded the prestigious Doctoral Dissertation Award by the Jean Piaget Society, USA, in 2023. His research has been featured in leading journals such as <i>Nature Human Behavior</i>, <i>Royal Society Open Science</i>, <i>Developmental Science</i>, <i>Infancy</i>, <i>Infant Behavior & Development</i>, <i>Psychological Research</i>, <i>Adaptive Behavior</i>, <i>Memory Studies<i>Philosophical Psychology</i>, <i>Theory & Psychology</i>, and <i>Collabra: Psychology</i>.</p>
