            <p class="speaker-name">Dr. Iris Nomikou</p>
            <p class="speaker-bio">Iris Nomikou is co-Director of the Research Centre for Interaction, Development and Diversity and Senior Lecturer in Psychology at the University of Portsmouth, UK. Her work crosses disciplinary boundaries and draws from interactional linguistics, cognitive science, and developmental psychology. She studies everyday interactions using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to holistically capture the ways in which early interactional experiences provide the ecology within which children participate in meaning making and discover and learn language, She has worked extensively on the interplay between talk and bodily experience for the development of meaning. Taking a continuity approach to the development of language she is interested in the creative solutions and different developmental paths that children use in learning to get things done with language, and has therefore also worked with recordings of children from different cultural communities as well as atypically developing children.</p>
